The goal of this project was to be able to create a web page via HTML, Css, and Bootstrap. With the use of Bootstrap and images from a previous activity, I was able to take an analysis and create an interactive dashboard to display the visuals.
Through the creation of 7 pages, a viewer should be able to tell a little bit more about the previous project completed. 
Created a landing page, 4 pages for the four main visualizations (one.html (Max Temperature), two.html (Humidity), three.html (Cloudiness), four.html (Wind Speed)), a comparisons page with all four visualizations that linked to each individual visiualization page, and lastly, a data page that had the table of all the plots used from the cities.csv profided.

Use of jupyter notebook & the to_html command was necessary to take the data from the cities.csv and get the code needed to run in Visual Studio. A style sheet was also created to house media queries for screen requirements and ensure that layout on the page was uniform when needed.

Use of Bootstrap navbar was needed to create a clickable dropdown to navigate to all of the necesary pages.
