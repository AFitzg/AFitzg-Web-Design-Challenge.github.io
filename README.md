# AFitzg-Web-Design-Challenge.github.io
The goal of this project was to be able to create a web page via HTML, Css, and Bootstrap. With the use of Bootstrap and images from a previous activity, I was able to take an analysis and create an interactive dashboard to display the visuals.
Through the creation of 7 pages, a viewer should be able to tell a little bit more about the previous project completed.
